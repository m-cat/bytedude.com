message: "Hey Bytedude! Thanks for this wonderful article. I initially came here for some neat looking syntax-highlighting stylesheet (=nimbus-pygments), but then I read the whole article. I think it totally makes sense to use divs instead of tables, so I implemented that to my Jekyll site. I also got the inline-highlight. With the initial stylesheet nimbus-pygments, and all these other nice additions, I somehow couldn't get it to work.\r\nI then saw, that you're whole website is on Github, so ~~I took alook at~~ I stole [https://github.com/m-cat/bytedude.com/blob/master/_sass/minutia/_syntax-highlighting.scss](your SCSS code) and adjusted it a bit for my needs. Just wanted to ask if that is okay?"
