  **Update:** I submitted a [PR to
  Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/pull/897) soon after this writing in
  order to get the `linewise` option supported by the syntax highlighter. If
  that PR gets accepted, I would submit another one to Jekyll to support
  `linedivs` natively, without the need for a plugin.While I'm still waiting for
  the PR to get merged (it's been almost a year!), it looks like it's been
  looked at by somebody -- finally!
